# actor-runtime

A minimal, self-contained "local Apify platform" in a single Docker image. Start
it with one `docker run`, point the stock `apify-cli` at it, and run the full
Actor dev loop: `apify push` -> build -> run -> inspect runs, builds and
the run's default storages (key-value store, dataset, request queue). The
runtime itself needs no outbound network access after the first build/push (see
`requirements/system.md`); the bundled sample Actors crawl the live web, so
running them does.

See `requirements/*.md` for the full behavioural spec (`system.md`, `api.md`,
`storage.md`, `actor-driver.md`, `cli.md`, `console.md`, `test.md`).

## Quick start

```bash
docker build -t actor-runtime .
docker run --rm -p 3333:3333 -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  actor-runtime
```

This mounts `./data` on the host as the runtime's `/data`, so every storage, build and run record
lands under `./data` for easy inspection.

```bash
export APIFY_CLIENT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3333
export APIFY_CONSOLE_URL=http://localhost:3000
npm install -g apify-cli

cd sample_actor_ts
apify push
apify call --input '{"maxPages":3}'
```

This assumes you're already logged in (`apify login`, any stored token works - the runtime maps any
non-empty token to its single local user). If that token happens to be a real Apify account token and
the real platform is reachable, the runtime also adopts that account's real username/id/proxy password
the first time it sees the token; fully offline (or with any other non-empty token) it just keeps using
the single local user, with no error either way - see `requirements/cli.md`'s User bootstrap section.

## Rapid dev loop: bind-mounting your local source (no rebuild per edit)

After the one push+build above, register your Actor's local source folder so every future run picks up
local edits without a rebuild:

```bash
apify api POST /actor-runtime/dev-folder/<actorId> --body '"/abs/path/to/sample_actor_ts"'
```

`<actorId>` is the id `apify push --json` printed (`.actor.id`); the path must be absolute and must
already exist on the **host** - the runtime verifies this by actually trying to mount it, and rejects
the call with a clear error if the Actor has no build tagged `latest` yet (a stock `apify push` always
tags its build `latest`, so this is normally just "build at least once first") or the path can't be
confirmed.
The same thing is also a single-field form on the Actor's page in the console (`http://localhost:3000`).

From then on:

```bash
# edit src/main.ts, then:
npm run build        # recompile locally - tsc, no apify push
apify call --input '{"maxPages":3}'   # picks up the new dist/, no rebuild
```

Node doesn't hot-reload a running process, so a local recompile is picked up by the **next** run's
container start, not by any run already in progress. `node_modules` inside the container still comes
from the built image - an anonymous volume preserves it underneath the bind mount - so a new dependency
in `package.json` still needs a real `apify push`/build; only source edits skip it. Clear the
registration with an empty body (`--body '""'`) to go back to running purely from the built image. Full
mechanics: `requirements/actor-driver.md`'s "Bind mount volumes with Actor source code";
endpoint/console details: `requirements/api.md`'s `/actor-runtime/*` section and
`requirements/console.md`.

## Debugging a run with a real IDE (breakpoints, step-through)

Turn debug mode on for an Actor once, then every `apify call` against it starts paused, waiting for a
debugger to attach - no change to the Actor's own source, Dockerfile, or `requirements.txt`:

```bash
apify api POST /actor-runtime/debug/<actorId> --body '{"enabled": true}'
apify call
```

The run's log prints one line with everything you need: the resolved language, the debug tool, the
listen/publish address, and the attach action for the relevant IDE - PyCharm's **Attach to DAP** or
VS Code's **Python: Remote Attach** for Python (default port `5678`), VS Code's **Attach** for Node
(default port `9229`). Connect, and execution proceeds to your own first breakpoint - the runtime never
sets one of its own.

Override the language (for an image the auto-detection can't classify) and/or the port:

```bash
apify api POST /actor-runtime/debug/<actorId> --body '{"enabled": true, "language": "node", "port": 9230}'
```

A `POST` fully replaces the prior toggle state - omitting `language`/`port` resets them to their own
defaults, it does not keep whatever a previous call set. Clear the toggle to go back to running
normally:

```bash
apify api POST /actor-runtime/debug/<actorId> --body '{"enabled": false}'
```

The run's own `timeoutSecs` (`apify call --timeout`) is **not** extended while paused - a session that
runs long still needs a larger `--timeout` passed up front. An image whose `CMD` can't be debugged this
way (e.g. `npm start` - it would attach to npm, not your Actor) fails the run immediately, before any
container is created, with a message naming the fix. **This includes any Node Actor pushed without its
own `Dockerfile`**: this runtime's injected default Dockerfile inherits its base image's own
`CMD ["npm", "start", "--silent"]`, so it's refused the same way. The fix: give the Actor a `Dockerfile`
whose `CMD` invokes `node` directly, e.g. `CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]`. The same toggle is also a
three-field form (`enabled`/`language`/`port`) on the Actor's page in the console. Full mechanics:
`requirements/actor-driver.md`'s "Debug mode" section; endpoint/console details: `requirements/api.md`'s
`/actor-runtime/*` section and `requirements/console.md`.

## Publishing the image

Images currently go to the temporary dev repository
[`josefprochazka/actor-runtime-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/josefprochazka/actor-runtime-dev) (it
will move to an Apify-owned namespace later).

The **Release Docker image** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is manual only: Actions ->
Release Docker image -> Run workflow, pick the branch in **Use workflow from**, and run it. That is
the only branch to choose - the workflow always builds the branch it was dispatched from. Everything
else is optional: an extra tag such as `v0.1.0`, whether to also move `:latest`, and which platforms
to build.

It pushes one multi-arch manifest per tag - `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` by default - so the same
tag serves x86_64 and Apple Silicon. Every run publishes `<branch>-<short-sha>` (immutable) and
`<branch>` (moving), with `/` in a branch name slugified to `-`. It needs two repository secrets:
`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (a Docker Hub access token with Read/Write from
<https://hub.docker.com/settings/security>).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build     # tsc
pnpm test          # unit + integration (no Docker needed)
pnpm run test:e2e  # full CLI-driven dev loop against a built image (requires Docker)
pnpm run dev       # run the server directly against ./data with tsx
```

`pnpm run dev` sets `ACTOR_RUNTIME_DATA_DIR=./data` inline in the script (`DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` otherwise
falls back to the container path `/data` - see `src/config.ts`); this only works as written on a
POSIX shell (Linux/macOS). On Windows, set the env var separately before running `tsx src/index.ts`
(e.g. in PowerShell: `$env:ACTOR_RUNTIME_DATA_DIR="./data"; tsx src/index.ts`), or use a cross-platform
env-setter like `cross-env` if you add it as a dependency.

## Bumping the pinned Crawlee v4 version

`@crawlee/core` and `@crawlee/fs-storage` are pinned to the exact version the npm `v4` dist-tag
resolves to (both must move in lockstep - `@crawlee/fs-storage` pins its own native addon,
`@crawlee/fs-storage-native`). To bump:

```bash
pnpm view @crawlee/core dist-tags.v4
pnpm view @crawlee/fs-storage dist-tags.v4   # should match
# update both versions in package.json, then:
pnpm install
pnpm run build && pnpm test
```

While bumping, check whether the `pnpm.overrides` pin on `@crawlee/fs-storage-native` in
`package.json` is still needed: it forces the first release with linux-arm64 bindings
(`0.1.5-beta.19`, API-identical to the `0.1.5-beta.18` that released `@crawlee/fs-storage`
versions still depend on). Once the bumped `@crawlee/fs-storage` depends on `>= 0.1.5-beta.19`
on its own, delete the override.

## Apify Proxy

Set `APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD` in the runtime container's own environment (e.g. `docker run -e
APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD=your-password ...`) to have it forwarded, unscoped, into every Actor container's
`APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD`. Leave it unset and the variable is simply absent from every Actor container -
never a placeholder value.
