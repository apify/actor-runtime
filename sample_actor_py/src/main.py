"""Python sample actor for actor-runtime.

Mirrors `sample_actor_ts`: crawls a live site (`startUrl` input, defaulting to
`https://crawlee.dev/`) up to `maxPages` pages with `ParselCrawler` over the Actor's default
request queue, pushes one dataset item per page, and charges the same pay-per-event events.
