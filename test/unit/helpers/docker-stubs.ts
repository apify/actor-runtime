/**
 * A stub `dockerode`-shaped object covering only what `startRun` calls, with `container.wait()` and the
 * `container.logs()` stream each independently controllable - mirrors the real Docker daemon's two
 * genuinely separate API connections (the finding this fixes: nothing guarantees the log stream's final
 * chunk has arrived by the time `container.wait()` resolves).
 *
 * Lives in this non-`.test.ts` helper file - not in `docker-driver.test.ts` itself - specifically so
 * `resource-sampler.test.ts` can import it too: a `.test.ts` file's top-level code (its own `describe`/
 * `it` registrations included) re-runs as a side effect of another test file importing anything from it,
 * which would silently double-execute every one of `docker-driver.test.ts`'s own tests. Extended (not
 * reimplemented) by `resource-sampler.test.ts` via `Object.assign`-ing a `container.stats()` mock onto the
 * returned `container` - the same extend-in-place pattern `docker-driver.test.ts`'s own
 * `stubDockerForCapacity` uses for `init()`'s extra surface.
