# Actor build

- The system builds an Actor's docker image over the **host Docker socket** rather than
  Docker-in-Docker, keeping the host's image layer cache available.
- A build is produced by building a docker image from the Actor source that was pushed to the system.
- Build and run output is persisted as the job's log and fanned out live to any open
  `GET /v2/logs/:id?stream=true` response.
- **Status state machine**: `READY -> RUNNING -> SUCCEEDED | FAILED | TIMED-OUT | ABORTED`, with
  `RUNNING -> ABORTING -> ABORTED` while a stop is in flight (`ABORTING`/`ABORTED` are also reachable
  directly from `READY` - an abort issued before the build/run ever started).
- Both builds and runs can end `TIMED-OUT` (timeout deadline reached) or `ABORTED`.
- a **run's** timeout is caller-configurable (`timeoutSecs` on `POST .../runs`, default **300s** if omitted)
- a **build's** timeout is a fixed internal default **1800s**
- **Abort and timeout are race-proof.** A build/run never moves out of a terminal status; only the
  transitions drawn above ever occur. `POST /actor-builds/:id/abort` and `POST /actor-runs/:id/abort`
  move the record to `ABORTING`, then `ABORTED`; once `ABORTING` is set, the job's own eventual
  completion - whatever status it computes, whenever it lands - never overwrites the abort. An abort
  issued while the record is still `READY` means no build or container is ever started; the record
  finalises as `ABORTED`.
- Aborting a **build** genuinely cancels the in-flight Docker build, not just the record's status;
  aborting a **run** stops the run's container.
- On a successful build, the Actor's `taggedBuilds[<tag>]` is updated with the new build's id and
  number - stock `apify push` polls for exactly this field before returning.
- Actor, build, and build-log details are kept in internal records that persist across runtime
  restarts (`storage.md`).
- **The Dockerfile to build is resolved from the Actor's pushed source**, not Docker's implicit default. `.actor/actor.json` is parsed as JSON5; an unparseable file fails the build with a "Could not parse .actor/actor.json" message. Resolution order, stopping at the first hit:
    1. the `dockerfile` field of `.actor/actor.json`, relative to `.actor/` - a path escaping the Actor root fails with "points outside the Actor root directory"; a non-string value fails with `"dockerfile" must be a string`; a value naming no pushed file (including empty) falls through instead of failing.
    2. `.actor/Dockerfile`
    3. `Dockerfile` at the Actor root
    4. the platform's bundled default Dockerfile, for that build only - the pushed source itself is unchanged.
    - Matching is case-insensitive, exact-case wins ties, and every outcome is stated in the build log.

# Bind mount volumes with Actor source code

- To let an Actor be re-run with source changes and no rebuild, the Actor's registered local dev
  folder is bind-mounted over the built image's working directory when the run's container starts:
  edit locally, recompile locally (`tsc`, or the language-appropriate equivalent), `apify call`
  again - no `apify push`/build in between. A running container never picks up a recompile; only the
  next run's container start does. Dependency or environment changes still require a real rebuild.
- `localDevFolder` is **registered explicitly**: the local-only endpoint
  `POST /actor-runtime/dev-folder/:actorId` (`api.md`) or a single-field form on the console's Actor
  detail view (`console.md`) sets or clears it, with identical outcomes for the same input on both
  surfaces.
- Registration validates that the submitted value is an absolute POSIX path and that the path exists
  **on the host** and is a directory.
    - The existence check goes through the container engine itself (the runtime's own filesystem is not
      the host's), and it must be side-effect free and identical on Docker and Podman: a never-started
      probe container binds the host's `/` read-only and the candidate is stat'ed beneath that mount
      through the engine's archive-stat endpoint, component by component so symlinks resolve to what they
      point at on the host. The probe never binds the candidate path itself - Podman's Docker-compatible
      API auto-creates a missing bind-mount source instead of rejecting it, which would both mis-report
      a typo as present and leave an empty directory behind on the host.
    - Submitting the **empty string clears the registration** and skips validation.
    - Every non-success outcome is classified: unable to verify at all (e.g. Docker unreachable)
      reports "could not verify" - never "does not exist"; a path confirmed missing reports "path
      does not exist"; a path that exists but is a file reports "path is not a directory"; anything
      else unverifiable reports a generic "could not verify".
- **Registration has no build-first precondition** - it requires no build of the Actor to exist,
  succeeded or otherwise.
- The working directory the mount covers is recorded **per build**, never on the Actor
  (`storage.md`); the mount a run applies always uses the one from _that run's own resolved build_,
  never any other build the Actor happens to have.
- **The mount is applied only when both a registered dev folder and a known working directory exist**
  for the run's resolved build; either missing means the run starts exactly as if the feature did not
  exist.
- The registration status the console and API report is the registered folder alone - never that a
  mount "will apply", since that depends on which build a given run resolves.
- If the registered folder has since been deleted, moved, or made unreadable, the run must **fail
  visibly** - never silently mount an empty directory in its place. The runtime enforces this itself,
  re-running the registration-time existence check before the run's container is created, rather than
  relying on the engine to reject the mount: Docker would, but Podman would auto-create the missing
  folder and start the run against it. The failed run's status message names the folder, what is wrong
  with it, and how to clear the registration.
- The Actor image's own installed dependencies (e.g. `node_modules`) must remain available to the Actor
  despite the mount covering the whole working directory.
- **Registering or clearing a dev folder never bumps the Actor's `modifiedAt`.**

# Debug mode

- Debug mode is a **persistent per-Actor toggle**, set and read through the local-only endpoint
  `POST /actor-runtime/debug/:actorId` (`api.md`) or a form on the console's Actor detail view
  (`console.md`), with identical outcomes for the same input on both surfaces. It is not a per-run flag:
  turning it on for an Actor pauses every subsequent run of that Actor until the toggle is cleared, and
  stock `apify call`'s invocation/flags/exit behavior never change - the workflow is: toggle once, then
  run normally.
- The toggle stores `enabled`, `language` (`auto` - the default - `node`, or `python`), and an optional
  `port` override. A `POST` fully replaces the prior state for that Actor (never a partial merge): a
  field the body omits resets to its own default rather than keeping whatever the previous call set.
  Submitting `{"enabled": false}` clears the whole toggle back to unset, regardless of what else the body
  names.
- **Language resolution happens at run start**, not at toggle time, since the toggle itself requires no
  build to exist yet. `language: "auto"` detects Node vs. Python from the run's resolved build image; an
  image it cannot classify is refused (see below) rather than guessed at. An explicit `language:
"node"`/`"python"` override always wins, skipping detection (and any refusal it could produce)
  entirely - it exists for images the heuristic cannot classify.
- **Default debug ports are language-specific**: `5678` for Python, `9229` for Node, each ecosystem's own
  IDE-default convention - applied once the run's language has resolved (the toggle's own read-back
  shows a nominal `5678` for an unresolved `language: "auto"`, purely for display). An explicit `port`
  override always wins over the resolved language's own default.
- **Activation never touches the container's `Cmd`/`Entrypoint`** - a debug run starts paused, waiting
  for a debugger, with zero changes required to the Actor's own source, Dockerfile, or
  `requirements.txt`. For Python, the runtime injects a `debugpy` payload into the container; execution
  proceeds to the developer's own first breakpoint once a debugger attaches - the runtime never sets a
  breakpoint of its own.
- **If the runtime cannot supply the Python debugpy payload** (e.g. it is not running from its own built
  image), the run fails with a clear message rather than starting undebugged.
- **The debug port is published on the host, bound to `127.0.0.1`.** A host port already in use fails the
  run, naming the port and the `port` override as the fix.
- **The run log carries one line, before the container is created**, stating: that the run is paused
  waiting for a debugger; the resolved language; the debug tool and (for Python) its injected version;
  the listen address inside the container and the published host address; the attach action for the
  relevant IDE (PyCharm's "Attach to DAP" / VS Code's "Python: Remote Attach" for Python; VS Code's
  "Attach" / Chrome DevTools for Node); and that the run's timeout is unchanged and not extended for
  debugging.
- **The run's timeout is completely unaffected by debug mode.** The configured `timeoutSecs` (default
  300s) is measured from container start regardless of whether a debugger ever attaches - a
  paused-waiting session gets no extra grace period, and the run still finalises `TIMED-OUT` (with its
  container removed) exactly like any other run whose timeout elapses. Passing a larger
  `apify call --timeout` is the way to get more time.
- **Non-debuggable images fail the run, loudly, before any container is created**, the same way every
  other pre-container failure does. A package-manager launcher (`npm start`, `yarn start`, `pnpm
start`, ...) is refused by name, naming both the `CMD` fix and how to clear debug mode. An
  unclassifiable `language: "auto"` image is refused the same way, naming the `language` override as the
  fix. Neither refusal ever leaves a container behind. This includes any Actor pushed with no
  `Dockerfile` of its own: the runtime's injected default Dockerfile inherits its base image's own
  `npm start` default, so it is refused exactly like any other package-manager-launched image.
- **The resolved plan is persisted on the run record itself** (local-only, never on `/v2` - see
  `storage.md`), available before the container starts - this is what lets the console show an attach
  address after the fact (`console.md`), even for a run started by someone else's `apify call`, and even
  after the run has finished.
- **Debug mode composes with the dev-folder bind mount** - the two features are independent and both
  apply to the same run when both are configured for an Actor, e.g. edit -> recompile -> `apify call` ->
  breakpoint, with no rebuild in between.

# Networking

- On startup, the runtime ensures a Docker network `apify-local` exists and joins it under the fixed
  DNS alias `apify-api`. Every Actor container is started on that network, so it can reach the
  runtime's API at `http://apify-api:3333` regardless of the host's own networking.
- When the runtime cannot join that network itself - it is not running in a container at all, or the
  engine refuses the attach (rootless Podman runs the runtime container under slirp4netns/pasta, where
  joining a second network is unsupported) - it must still make `http://apify-api:3333` reachable from
  every Actor container: it logs a warning naming the cause and the `--network apify-local` alternative,
  and gives each Actor container an `apify-api -> host-gateway` extra host, so the alias lands on the
  runtime's port 3333 as published on the host (`system.md`'s mandatory `-p 3333:3333`). The extra host
  is never added when the alias resolves through the network, since a hosts-file entry would override it.

# Actor run

- The system runs Actors as containers
- A run launches the Actor's built image as a container, with the Actor's input and its default
  storages (key-value store, dataset, request queue) wired in **entirely over HTTP** - the run's
  storages are reachable only through `APIFY_API_BASE_URL`.
- Run details and the run log are kept in internal records that persist across runtime restarts
  (`storage.md`).

## Resource limits

- Every run's container has a hard memory limit and a hard CPU limit. Memory is the run's `memoryMbytes`;
  CPU is derived from it at the platform's ratio of one core per 4096 MB, so a 1024 MB run gets 0.25 core.
- A derived CPU limit below what Docker accepts is raised to that minimum.
- Limits are applied exactly as requested, even when they exceed the host's own capacity. Such a run is
  warned about in its own log, naming the requested and the host figures; the limits still apply. When the
  host's capacity cannot be determined, no warning is produced.
- Disk is not limited. `diskMbytes` is reported but never enforced.

## Run resource telemetry

- While a run's container is up, its CPU and memory usage are measured once a second and published as
  `systemInfo` events on the run's events channel (`api.md`).
- Every event carries all eight fields - `memAvgBytes`, `memCurrentBytes`, `memMaxBytes`, `cpuAvgUsage`,
  `cpuMaxUsage`, `cpuCurrentUsage`, `isCpuOverloaded`, `createdAt` - or is not published at all. A
  measurement that cannot be read completely is skipped, leaving the run's running figures unaffected.
    - `cpuCurrentUsage` is percent of one CPU core, not of the run's own grant - measured as the
      container's CPU time over the wall time between two successive readings, which means the same
      thing on every engine (Podman's `system_cpu_usage`, the input to `docker stats`' own formula, is not
      on Docker's scale).
    - `memCurrentBytes` and `memAvgBytes` exclude reclaimable page cache, matching what `docker stats`
      reports for the same container.
    - `memMaxBytes` is the run's configured memory limit, constant for its lifetime.
    - `isCpuOverloaded` is true when used cores exceed 95% of the run's granted cores.
    - `memAvgBytes`, `cpuAvgUsage` and `cpuMaxUsage` cover every sample published for that run so far.
- Measurement lasts exactly as long as the container: it starts once the container is running and stops
  before the container is removed, and it never delays a run from reaching a terminal state.
- The bundled sample Actors log their granted resources and each `systemInfo` event they receive, so the
  contract is observable from a single `apify call`.

# Users

- Users are created adhoc by the runtime for each new token used in the API call (`cli.md`'s User bootstrap).

# Environment variables in every Actor container

- The Actor version's own `envVars` (accepted and stored on `POST`/`PUT
.../actors/:actorId/versions`) are applied to the run's container environment, but every
  platform-owned var listed below takes precedence: a version cannot override `APIFY_TOKEN`, the
  default storage ids, or any other contract var the runtime itself sets.
- `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME=1` (mirrors the real platform; an SDK/client instantiated
  in the container reports `isAtHome`/`is_at_home = true`).
- `APIFY_META_ORIGIN` — `API` for ordinary runs (every local run arrives via
  the API, apify-cli included)
- `APIFY_API_BASE_URL` — the runtime's own API, reachable by name from any
  Actor container on the shared Docker network (see "Networking" above).
- `APIFY_TOKEN` — the run owner's token
- `APIFY_DEFAULT_KEY_VALUE_STORE_ID` / `APIFY_DEFAULT_DATASET_ID` /
  `APIFY_DEFAULT_REQUEST_QUEUE_ID` — the run's real storage ids (as returned by
  the API)
- `APIFY_ACTOR_ID` / `ACTOR_ID` and `APIFY_ACTOR_RUN_ID` / `ACTOR_RUN_ID` —
  both the legacy `APIFY_`-prefixed and the modern unprefixed spellings, equal
  in value.
- `APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD` — set when a value is known, from either of two sources in precedence order:
  (1) `APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD` set in the runtime's own environment (README.md's "Apify Proxy" section) —
  always wins when set; otherwise (2) the proxy password obtained for the run owner's own account during
  User bootstrap (`cli.md`). If neither source has a value, the key is absent entirely — never a
  placeholder.
- `ACTOR_EVENTS_WEBSOCKET_URL` / `APIFY_ACTOR_EVENTS_WS_URL` — the run's own events channel
  (`api.md`), carrying no credential.
- `ACTOR_MEMORY_MBYTES` / `APIFY_MEMORY_MBYTES` — the run's requested `memoryMbytes`.
- `APIFY_DEDICATED_CPUS` — the run's granted CPU cores. No `ACTOR_`-prefixed counterpart; only the
  Python SDK reads it.
- Every `ACTOR_*`/`APIFY_*` pair above is set to an identical value (the two SDKs disagree on which name
  wins).
