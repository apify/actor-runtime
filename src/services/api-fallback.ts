/**
 * Upstream API fallback (the `setApiFallbackState` operation in `src/api/openapi/actor-runtime.json`): when a call locally misses - either
 * because nothing in this runtime serves the path/method at all, or because it does but the specific
 * record id doesn't exist - and the matching toggle is on, the request is replayed against the real
 * Apify platform instead of failing, and a successful reply's status/body/headers are relayed back
 * (see the response-header note on `attemptFallback` below - not every repeated header line survives
 * relay byte-for-byte, because the HTTP client this module uses does not hand back every repeated
 * upstream header as separate entries; `Set-Cookie` is the one name it always keeps separate, and is
 * the one name this module always preserves as separate lines for exactly that reason). Both toggles
 * default off and reset on every restart; this module is the only place either fact is read or written,
 * by the API route (`api/routes/api-fallback.ts`), the console's `/settings` page, and
 * `console/templates.ts: layout()`'s per-page state indicator alike.
 *
 * `attemptFallback` is the single seam both of `server.ts`'s local-miss sites (the terminal catch-all
 * and the generic error middleware) call through - it alone knows the eligibility mapping below, the
 * replay request, and how a response does or doesn't get relayed.

/**
 * The one function both local-miss seams in `server.ts` call. Returns `true` when the response has been
 * fully sent from upstream (the caller must not also send the local error), `false` when this call was
 * never eligible, or eligible but abandoned - either way the original local error is still the caller's
 * to send.
 *
 * Eligibility, in order: the local error's `type` must map to a trigger (above) and that trigger's
 * toggle must be on; the request must be under `/v2/*`, excluding `/v2/actor-runtime/*`; the request
 * must be authenticated (`req.user` - every `/v2/*` request, off-spec paths included, passes `auth()`
 * before reaching either seam, so this only ever fails for a request this runtime never authenticated at
 * all, e.g. one outside `/v2` entirely). All HTTP methods are eligible once these hold, writes included.
 *
 * Replay is `<upstreamApiBaseUrl()><req.originalUrl>` (byte-exact, percent-encoding intact), the
 * caller's own presented token (`req.user.token`, unconditionally - see `services/users.ts`) as the only
 * `Authorization` header, `content-type`/`accept` forwarded when the inbound request carried them,
 * nothing else. One attempt, redirects followed, a 30s timeout. Only a final `2xx` is relayed: status
 * and body unchanged, headers minus the hop-by-hop exclusion set below. `Set-Cookie` is always relayed
 * as one line per cookie the platform set, via `Headers.getSetCookie()` - the one header name the
 * platform's HTTP client (`fetch`/undici) guarantees it can hand back as separate entries, which is also
 * the one name where comma-joining would be wrong (a cookie's own value can contain a comma). Any other
 * header the platform repeats is relayed as a single, comma-joined value - the RFC 7230-legitimate
 * representation for a repeated list-valued field, and the only representation `fetch`'s `Headers`
 * exposes for anything other than `Set-Cookie` (it joins repeated non-cookie header lines together
 * before this function ever sees them). Anything other than a final `2xx` - non-2xx, timeout, DNS/connect
 * failure, or the upstream dying *after* a final `2xx` status/headers but before the body finishes -
 * is fail-closed (this function returns `false`, changing nothing about the response), logged at
 * `warn`. A relay is logged at `log`.
 *
 * This function never rejects: both call sites in `server.ts` are the terminal middleware for their
 * respective seam, so a rejection here would escape to Express's own `finalhandler` instead of
 * producing the local error response - every fallible step between the status check and `res.send()` is
 * therefore wrapped in its own `try`/`catch` that logs and returns `false` on any throw, exactly like the
 * initial `fetch` itself already does. The one deliberate exception is the success log and `return true`
 * that follow `res.send()`: they sit outside that `try` on purpose, and cannot themselves turn a
 * completed relay back into `false` - see the comment just above them.
