/**
 * The Docker driver: build/run Actor images over the host Docker socket via `dockerode`. Every Actor
 * container joins the `apify-local` network so it can resolve the runtime's own container by the
 * fixed DNS alias `apify-api` (`actor-driver.md`). Storage access is HTTP-only; the only filesystem
 * bind mounts this driver ever adds are the optional local-dev-folder mount on a real run
 * (`RunContext.devMount`, see `startRun` below) - conditional, never unconditional, on every Actor's
 * container - and the read-only probe mount `probeDevFolder` creates to validate a candidate dev folder
 * before it is ever registered (see below), whose container is never started.
 *
 * `probeDevFolder`'s container is created against `ensureProbeImage`'s own minimal image, not any
 * Actor's build - registering a dev folder must work for an Actor that has never been built. That image
 * is a one-line `FROM scratch` Dockerfile built the same `buildImage`-plus-in-memory-tar way as an Actor
 * build, so it needs no network access; built lazily on first use and reused after that, never rebuilt
 * per registration.
 *
 * Genuine cancellation: `docker.buildImage()` accepts an `abortSignal` option that dockerode forwards
 * all the way to Node's `http.request({ signal })` (`docker-modem/lib/modem.js`: `optionsf.signal =
 * options.abortSignal`, then `http[...].request(opts, ...)` in `buildRequest`) - aborting it destroys
 * the in-flight HTTP request to the daemon, and `followProgress`'s stream then emits `error`/`close`
 * (`dockerode/lib/buildkit.js`'s `onStreamError`), so `startBuild`'s promise settles instead of hanging
 * or silently ignoring the abort. One `AbortController` is kept per in-flight build, keyed by build id,
 * so `abortBuild` can call `.abort()` on the live one. Runs are cancelled the same way as before -
 * `container.stop()` - since there is no HTTP request to abort there.
 *
 * Unverified in this sandbox: there is no Docker socket here, so `init()` always finds
 * `available: false` and every build/run fails fast with a clear status message instead of hanging.
 * The rest of the runtime (storages, actors-as-records, console) is unaffected.
